# UKIE-Game-Jam-2018
Game made for the UKIE Game Jam Students 2018



The annual Ukie Student Game Jam is returning on 22nd and 23rd October, with teams from across our student membership competing to win the Ukie Student trophy. 

Want to know how to win? The judging criteria of the game jam is as follows:

1) Concept

How well does it match the theme?

2) Playability

Is it fun and challenging enough to play?

3) Visual impression

Does the art style suit the game?

4) Narrative

Does the game's story work and flow?

5) Replayability

Is it compelling and does it have high replay value?

6) Soundtrack

Does the audio fit the game?

7) Creativity

How creative and unique is the game?

8) Accessibility

How accessible is it to gamers with hearing, vision, cognitive or motor impairments?

Accessibility for the 20%+ of gamers who have some form of disability is a rapidly growing area in game development, with more developers than ever before thinking about everything from colourblindness to deafness, cerebral palsy to epilepsy. The device manufacturers are starting to get involved too, with recent updates adding a raft of accessibility features to both the PS4 and Vita. It means your game being able to reach a wider audience, and improved quality of life for people who rely on gaming for access to recreation, culture and socialising.

Games generally can't be accessible to everyone, because there has to be some kind of challenge involved. But there is a great deal that can be done to avoid unnecessarily excluding people. Even in the space of a two day jam. It doesn't mean dumbing down your idea or designing for a niche, instead it is about opening up the same enjoyment to more people.

Below are five considerations to help reach as broad an audience as possible. They apply to most game mechanics and are easily achievable if thought about early enough. 

1. Keep controls as simple as possible

Taps and presses are easier for gamers with motor impairments than gestures and complex combinations.

2. Give players as much time as they need to read text

Dismissing text prompts on a player action rather than on timer means that players who have difficulty reading donâ€™t miss out on important information.

3. Ensure important elements are easy to see

Use high contrast visuals with interactive elements clearly highlighted, and use well spaced mixed-case text in a clear typeface.

4. Avoid communicating important information by colour alone

Use symbol, shape or pattern in addition to colour, to avoid excluding colour-blind gamers.

5. Avoid communicating important information by sound alone

Include gamers with hearing loss by reinforcing audio prompts with visual prompts, and reinforcing speech with subtitles.

There are many other things that might work for your game, depending on your mechanic. They are often just simple design decisions that are good game design for all players, and usually mean either communicating information in more than one way, or offering players some sort of flexibility in how they play.
